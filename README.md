# cs50project0
hey so this was my cs50 project 0 in this i've created a frontend for google where there are 3 pages in total :
the google home page 
advanced search page 
and the images page

you can visit any of them by clicking on the links given there and they also do the work like if u search for query on google home page then it will give u the search results and if u click the i'm feeling lucky button (after writing your query there) u'll be taken to the first search results page for the query.

then there's google images page also where u can write a query and be taken to the images directly

and advanced search has 4 attributes which can be filled accordingly to get the search results

and this whole project is made by just using HTML-CSS only and yeah it's my first project i've made till now.
